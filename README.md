# Dnd Character Creator
Ideally this should become a cross platform (android, local web and ios) application that will allow users to quickly build characters for DND.
Eventually will support 5e completely and core 3.5 (because that it is really big)

## Dev Notes
This is written in dart using the flutter library, to set up the environment I would show you to (here)[https://flutter.dev/].<br>
This will try and implement (sqlite3)[https://www.sqlite.org/index.html] to locally database and this should also mean some portability of platform if you are comfortable messing with the code your self. though last of my knowledge at time of writing this will create some issue with the ios and web versions<br>
hopefully I can get this published in an app store
